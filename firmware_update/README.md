Steps for udpdating Fipy and Pysense firmware. It is important to follow these instructions in order.

1. Flash PySense/PyTrack/Expansion board
2. Flash FiPy

# PySense/PyTrack/Expansion board firmware update
Update the firmware. To do so:
- **IMPORTANT**: Close Atom or any other software that could be using the serial port.
- Navigate to *firmware_update/dfu-utils* and have this command prepared to be run in your terminal (don't run it yet):

```bash
sudo dfu-util -D ../pysense_0.0.8.dfu # (Linux)

dfu-util-static.exe -D ..\pysense_0.0.8.dfu # (Windows)
```

- Unplug the board
- Remove any FiPy, if there is any
- Press and hold the S1/MCLR button on your device (highlighted in red below)
- Plug in the USB cable to the host computer and wait 1 second before releasing the button
- After this you will have approximately 7 seconds to run the command described above

if not, try again. ü§∑‚Äç

If nothing works after several tries, there's a way that works for Windows. For that, use the software [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and repeat the process to update the firmware described above but instead of running the command line, you have to select the driver ```libusbK```. More information can be found [here](https://docs.pycom.io/updatefirmware/expansionboard/).
